    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sexual Selection
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Directed at certain traits of sexually freproducing species that make it more likely for individuals to find or choose a mate
            \item In many species, male characteristics affected more intensely than female
            \item \underline{Intrasexual}:\ same sex, males directly compete for mating opportunities or territories
            \item \underline{Intersexual}:\ opposite sex, females choose male possessing a particular phenotype
        \end{itemize}
        \item Maintenance of Variations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Genetic Variability
            \item Populations with limited variation may not be able to adapt to new conditions
            \item Maintenance of Variability is advantageous to population
            \item Only exposed alleles are subject to natural selection
            \item Natural selection does no cause genetic change
        \end{itemize}
        \item What is a Species?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Macroevolution:\ evolutionary changes that create new species and groups of species; accumulation of microevolutionary changes over long periods of time
            \item Speciation:\ the splitting of one species into two or more species or the transformation of one species into a new species over time
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
